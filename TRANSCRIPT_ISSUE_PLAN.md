# YouTube Transcript Issue Troubleshooting Plan

This document outlines our systematic approach to resolving the YouTube transcript fetching issue that occurs on the Vercel deployment but not in local development.

## Current Issue

- ‚úÖ Application works correctly in local development environment
- ‚ùå Application fails on Vercel deployment with error: `Failed to fetch video transcript: [YoutubeTranscript] üö® Transcript is disabled on this video`

## Hypotheses

1. **CORS Restrictions**: Vercel's environment may have stricter CORS policies than local development
2. **YouTube IP Blocking**: YouTube may be blocking or restricting requests from Vercel's server IP ranges
3. **Library Compatibility**: The transcript fetching library might not be compatible with Vercel's serverless environment
4. **Authentication/Headers**: The requests from Vercel might be missing necessary headers or user-agent information
5. **Server vs. Client Execution**: The code might be executing in a different context (client vs server) on Vercel

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnosis and Information Gathering

- [x] **1.1 Examine Current Implementation**

  - [x] Locate the transcript fetching code in the codebase (`app/api/summarize/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/route.ts`)
  - [x] Identify which library/method is being used (`youtube-transcript` v1.0.6, method: `YoutubeTranscript.fetchTranscript(videoId)`)
  - [x] Determine if fetching happens on client or server side (Server-side via Next.js API routes)

- [ ] **1.2 Basic Vercel Debugging**

  - [ ] Add verbose logging to transcript fetching code
  - [ ] Deploy to Vercel and check logs for additional error information
  - [ ] Test with multiple known-good YouTube videos to confirm the pattern

- [ ] **1.3 Environment Comparison**
  - [ ] Document Node.js version in local vs Vercel
  - [ ] Check for any environment variables that might affect behavior
  - [ ] Compare package versions between environments

### Phase 2: Initial Fixes

- [ ] **2.1 Server-Side Implementation**

  - [ ] Create dedicated API route for transcript fetching if not already present
  - [ ] Ensure transcript fetching occurs server-side in a Next.js API route
  - [ ] Add proper error handling with specific error types
  - [ ] Deploy and test

- [ ] **2.2 CORS Handling**

  - [ ] Add appropriate CORS headers to requests
  - [ ] Use a proper user-agent string
  - [ ] Deploy and test

- [ ] **2.3 Error Handling Improvements**
  - [ ] Add graceful fallbacks for when transcripts aren't available
  - [ ] Improve error messages shown to users
  - [ ] Deploy and test

### Phase 3: Alternative Approaches

- [ ] **3.1 Try Official YouTube API**

  - [ ] Set up YouTube Data API credentials
  - [ ] Implement transcript fetching using official API
  - [ ] Add as environment variable to Vercel
  - [ ] Deploy and test

- [ ] **3.2 Alternative Libraries**

  - [ ] Research alternative YouTube transcript libraries
  - [ ] Implement a selected alternative
  - [ ] Deploy and test

- [ ] **3.3 Proxy Solution**
  - [ ] Create a proxy API endpoint that forwards requests to YouTube
  - [ ] Configure to mask server origins and appear as browser requests
  - [ ] Deploy and test

### Phase 4: External Service Integration (if needed)

- [ ] **4.1 Third-Party Transcript Services**
  - [ ] Evaluate services like AssemblyAI, Rev.ai, etc.
  - [ ] Implement integration with selected service
  - [ ] Deploy and test

## Monitoring and Validation

For each implementation step:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test with at least 3 different YouTube videos:
   - One with known captions
   - One with auto-generated captions
   - One in a non-English language

## Success Criteria

- Application successfully retrieves transcripts for videos that have them available
- Application properly handles and communicates when transcripts are unavailable
- Solution works consistently across multiple videos and over time

## Implementation Notes

- Document all attempted solutions
- For each attempt, note exactly what changed and the results
- Track any new error messages or behaviors

## Rollback Plan

If any implementation significantly degrades the application:

- Revert to the previous working deployment
- Document what caused the issue for future reference
